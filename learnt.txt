üîê How to defend against this
Here are defenses you can layer in to protect your app:

1. Secure your cookies
Always use Secure + HttpOnly

Use SameSite=Strict (or Lax for basic cross-site usage)

2. IP binding / Fingerprinting
Bind token to user IP address or User-Agent

If the token is used from a new device/IP ‚Üí invalidate it

3. Use Refresh Tokens + Short-lived Access Tokens
Access tokens expire quickly (e.g., 5-15 min)

Refresh tokens last longer, but are stored securely too

If access token is stolen, it becomes useless shortly

4. Logout & Rotation
On logout or detection of abuse ‚Üí revoke both tokens

Rotate refresh tokens after each use

5. Rate limiting + anomaly detection
Watch for abuse from unknown IPs

Throttle suspicious requests
